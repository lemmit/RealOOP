# RealOOP

Example of the OOP using that old definition of objects that send messages to each other. 
In languages like C# and Java objects are actually procedures with associated state. 
I was wondering if it is possible to implement fully OO system on top of it.

The code I've written looks now more and more like a very basic actor system.
Another point for using actors!

## What you can find inside?
The examples shows how to define and create object, inherit and override objects, 
compose object dynamically using mixins and change it runtime.
Calls between objects are fully asynchronous.

## TODO
* Add some message correlation system [Ask<->Answer]

Probably those TODOs gonna stay there for a while...
